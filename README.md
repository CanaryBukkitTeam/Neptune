## Cloning

The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. `git clone https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneMod.git`
2. `cd NeptuneVanilla`

## Building

__Note:__ If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use ./gradlew for Unix systems or Git Bash and gradlew.bat for
Windows systems in place of any 'gradle' command.

In order to build NeptuneMod you simply need to run the `gradle build` command. You can find the compiled JAR 
files in `./build/libs` but in most cases you'll only need 'neptunemod-x.x.x-x.x.x.jar'.
